2. Go to **More Actions** > **Virtual Device Manager**.
3. Click **Create Device**.
4. Select **Tablet** from the category list on the left.
5. Choose a device like **Pixel C** (10-inch) or **Nexus 7** (7-inch) and click Next.
6. Select a system image (e.g., API 34) and finish setup.
7. Run your device by clicking the Play button.
8. Once the emulator is running, run `npx expo start` in your terminal and press `a` to open the app on the emulator.
9. Use the **Camera icon** in the emulator toolbar (top of the window) to take a perfect screenshot.
